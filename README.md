# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Exampleing
A Japanese car manufactuer wants to sell their vehicles in the US, using prior data understand the factors influecing price Using supervised learning algorithms in python. Showing the methods used to prepare data, including cleaning methods and feature engineering, as well as potential insights to be gained from the model used.

Introduction to the problem

Akashi is a Japanese car company that has recently recovered from a failed attempt to launch vehicles in the US market. During this attempt, sales were low as consumers found the cars to be overpriced. Executives had set price estimates based on previous experience setting prices in the Japanese market. This process relied heavily on unquantifiable intuition and assumed that factors influencing prices in Japan would be the same in the US.

Akashi’s management team has asked you to build a regression model based on a dataset of cars for sale in the American market. Their hope is that they’ll be able to use this model to predict the most appropriate price for the cars they’ll put on the American market.
